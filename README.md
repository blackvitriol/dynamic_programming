# Dynamic Programming
Using 'Dynamic Programming' to solve OpenAI's Frozen Lake using RL (policy iteration and value iteration)

## Overview
There are two functions used in Reinforcement Learning namely: policy iteration and value iteration. These are stored in 'functions'. We use OpenAI's Gym to load a Frozen Lake environment, which is similar to the classical AI environment of Wumpus World. The agent uses RL called from our dynamic programming functions to reach from a start state to a goal state. The program will return the decisions that need to be taken by the agent.

## Todo
Create graphical output of Frozen Lake

## Dependencies

* numpy 
* openAI's gym https://github.com/openai/gym

## Usage

Type in console: 'python frozen_lake.py' in terminal
